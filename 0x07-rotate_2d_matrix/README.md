#0x07-rotate_2d_matrix

This project provides a Python function to rotate a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place. The function takes a 2D matrix as input and modifies it directly to achieve the rotation.

#Usage

To use the rotate_2d_matrix function, follow these steps:

*    Import the function into Python script:

`from rotate_2d_matrix import rotate_2d_matrix`

Create a 2D matrix that you want to rotate. The matrix should be represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix.
```
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]
```

Call the rotate_2d_matrix function and pass the matrix as an argument:


`rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)`

The matrix will be rotated 90 degrees clockwise 


The output will be the rotated matrix:
```
    [[7, 4, 1],
     [8, 5, 2],
     [9, 6, 3]]

```
